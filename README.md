## About the project
Hackday through the bootcamp at salt. I often come up with ideas and find new technologies or APIs I would like to experiment with and try out. In this project we only had a day to implement the application and therefor as a result I took my collected bag of ideas and experimented with them in this project, I wanted to:

**Topics**
- Connect a React frontend with a Express backend
- React Routing and clear component structuring
- Experiment with the APIs and how I would use them in individual projects further

## What I used each API for
### Weather API
Display weather information about the city I am living in, filtered out the results down to what I actually need when checking the forecast.

### Country API 
Got used to what data you may recieve through this API and also more knowledge for how to incorporate these responses as a query for a new API request (e.g. Search for Norway, use capital Oslo as city for Weather API)

### E-sport API
A long project idea of mine where is to create a e-sport site which easily lets you customize what information you recieve as the user. During this project I am getting a match from a match in the video-game CS:GO where I wanted to show obvious information, aswell as cooler more interesting ones.
