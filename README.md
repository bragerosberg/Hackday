# Hackday

## Want to try out the project?
This section aswell as how to do it will be implemented once it's finished

## About the project
I often come up with ideas and find new technologies or APIs I would like to experiment with and try out. In this project we only had a day to implement the application and there  As a result of an accumulated bag of ideas I am in this project experimenting on multiple areas:

**Topics**
- React Routing
- The connecting of a React frontend with Express backend
- Using APIs responses as queries for other API requests
- Try out the APIs to plan the different projects future

**APIs**
- [Weather API](###Weather-API)
- [Country API](###Country-API)
- [Esport API](###Esport-API)

## How I want to use the APIs
### Weather API
Display relevant weather information regarding the location/country listed.

### Country API 
Wanting to combine the response of this API as a query for the [Weather API](##Weather-API). Therefor I will in this project try exactly that. 

### E-sport API
Long project idea of mine where I want to create a e-sport site which easily lets you customize what information you recieve as the user. To further elaborate:
** Filter on Esports **
- **Game** News and ongoing professional matches based on the video-game of preference (e.g. filter only DotA2 news, matches, streams)
- **Team** News and ongoing professional matches through out all the different games that given team is presented (e.g. Team Liquids news and matches through different games)
- **Combination(e.g. game & team)** Get news and ongoing professional matches through out the given game and team you have entered
